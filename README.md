## The Housing Management System 

The Housing Management System is a solution designed to efficiently manage housing societies, properties, tenants, and financial transactions. It automates tasks such as rent payments,
maintenance tracking, and tenant management, improving operational efficiency. The system features a relational database with entities like Society, Property, Tenant, Rent Payment, and 
Maintenance request interconnected through relationships. SQL queries (DDL, DML), views, triggers, and stored procedures manage and manipulate the data.

## Objective

The key objectives are:
1. Automate Property Management: Track property details, tenant information, and payments.
2. Improve Efficiency: Streamline rent payments, maintenance requests, and tenant management.
3. Provide Insights: Generate analytical reports on occupancy rates, revenue, and maintenance trends.
4. Support Scalability: Design a system that can scale as the agency expands.
5. Role-Based Access: Implement secure user access control for data integrity.
6. Cloud Deployment: Deploy the system on AWS for reliability and accessibility.
